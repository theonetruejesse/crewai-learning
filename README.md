informally following the course by andrew ng

### Issues

- failed with my setup initially, apparently need rust installed
- encountered issues with the documentation claiming that CrewAI supports Python <=3.13. Python interpreter version (3.13) is newer than PyO3's maximum supported version (3.12).
- when i add agents into the config yaml files that aren't used within the @CrewBase class, it breaks the crew

### Thoughts

- pretty impressed with their cli, project structure is super well designed; it's framework tier - uv adoption is making python project ecosystem competitive with npm and cargo
- need to check whether or not streaming is supported in crewai

### Todos

- Learn how to setup testing in python ecosystem
