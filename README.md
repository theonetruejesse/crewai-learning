Following the crewai course with Andrew Ng

### Notes

- failed with my setup initially, apparently need rust installed. so might wanna help contribute that
- I encountered issues with the documentation claiming that CrewAI supports Python <=3.13. Python interpreter version (3.13) is newer than PyO3's maximum supported version (3.12).
