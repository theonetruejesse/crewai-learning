Following the crewai course with Andrew Ng

### Issues

- failed with my setup initially, apparently need rust installed
- encountered issues with the documentation claiming that CrewAI supports Python <=3.13. Python interpreter version (3.13) is newer than PyO3's maximum supported version (3.12).

### Thoughts

- pretty impressed with their cli, project structure is super well designed; it's framework tier - uv adoption is making python project ecosystem competitive with npm and cargo
